            <br>
            <p class="text-justify">Delivrhyno is a national business based in the UK, specialising in providing
                take-away delivery services, in particular allowing our customers to order food from local
                establishments that may not offer their own take-away service. Delivrhyno cooperates with these
                establishments directly via our branch offices, allowing restaurants to always have up-to-date
                information available on our website. Customers can use the Delivrhyno website to choose menu items from
                any participating establishment in their area. Once an order is complete and paid for by the customer,
                it is then communicated to the restaurant which can then begin fulfilling the order. Once confirmation
                that the order is ready, a Delivrhyno driver will pick up the order and it will be transported to the
                customer's location.</p>
